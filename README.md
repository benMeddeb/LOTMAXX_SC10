# LOTMAXX_SC10

Follow instruction on how to install Klipper along with Fluidd or mainsail (Or Octoprint with octoklipper).  

The easiest way is to use  KIAUH script:   https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh


LOTMAXX SC-10 mainboard is in fact a locked down MKS Robin nano V 1.1 I have included the PIN OUT for you to correctly configure BL TOUCH, a second Z axis or even LEDs … etc … 

Also included a starter printer.cfg file configured for the SC-10. Z stop and filament runout sensor are also configured. (Uncomment BL touch section if you have one installed. Make sure the PINOUT is wired correctly)

Place the file LOTMAXX.bin into the SD card.
Turn on the printer and wait until flashing is complete . The Printer screen will blank out.  PROFIT!! 

Restart the printer from Fluidd or mainsail and start your tuning !! 

 Follow Klipper calibration manual online or get on youtube !! 

Post any questions specific to the SC-10 in the group. 

Thank you all !
